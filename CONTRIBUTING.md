- Custom CSS follows the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) convention;

Please be sure to check and follow them before attempt any modification to the sources, in order to preserve the general integrity of the project patterns.
Third-party linter plugins like ESLint, Beautify, Prettier or any other similar resource are welcome.
